## About This Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of my projects, experiments, and progress as I delve into programming. It is both a showcase and a diary, capturing my development as I navigate through the challenges and triumphs of learning and understanding different technologies.

## Goals

- **Understand the Fundamentals:** Grasp the basics of Javascript and especially Node.js, including asynchronous programming, the event loop, and modules.
- **Build Projects:** Apply what I learn by building small projects, gradually increasing in complexity.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** Use my growing skills to contribute to open source projects, learning from the global developer community.
- **Continuous Learning:** Stay updated with the latest programming features and best practices, incorporating them into my work.

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources I have used throughout my journey:
